**format_pdep.py** : The changes for this script were made to enable the necessities to operate on the local Windows project. The major change was modifying the references to the data locations as required on Windows, adding "../" for prepcorp.sqlite, pdep_train.conllu, and pdep_test.conllu. A minor change was adding a variable _count_ to identify the number of instances remaining after rows have not been used. This script was not actually executed, since we did not shuffle the corpus, but rather we used the train and the test files used in the actual execution in the G&S paper.

**counting.py** : This script was used to count the rows in **prepcorp.sqlite** that were not used. This script counts the number of the different kinds that were not used. It then creates the items of various types into **.txt** or **.tsv** files. The outputs of this script are described in detail in sections 3, 4, and 5 of the paper.
