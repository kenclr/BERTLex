As a result , by the end of the decade , output >>per<< person in manufacturing was half as much again as it had been at the start of the decade .	The fact that the cost >>per<< unit of his pesticides has risen , makes the effect more dramatic .	Earnings >>per<< share are down from 31p to 20.5p , the dividend is maintained at 20.5p with a final payment of 17p on June 16.	Losses >>per<< share were reduced to 0.3p from 21.2p in 1991.	The capital growth and income trust , which is run from Edinburgh by Baillie Gifford , invests internationally in smaller companies and saw its pre-tax revenue drop from Â£313,946 six months before to Â£288,562 , while earnings >>per<< share fell from 4.14p to 4p .	The price >>per<< slave , then , is this total cost divided by the number of slaves in the lot .	Depending on bulk , the price >>per<< tonne varied between $122 and $450 -- significantly less than most estimates of the cost of cutting emissions by fitting ' scrubbers ' .	The necessity for speed in adaptation of agricultural technology exists because of these self-reproducing and self-reinforcing processes -- fairly rapid population growth ; political and economic neglect of marginal environments except where they can be exploited for the production of commodities for the national and international market ; and a stagnant production >>per<< unit worker and area for the majority of the population .	Balanced growth requires that gross saving >>per<< worker just offsets depreciation and the capital-widening necessary to allow for the growth of the labour force .	Productivity , measured by cars >>per<< man-hour , is just as good as in Japan .	However , for initial budget purposes , it is sufficient to estimate these costs by using the average build costs >>per<< square foot achieved by others who have recently built their own home .	Where , for instance , remuneration is linked to earnings >>per<< share , managers have an interest in increasing short-term profits , which may be detrimental to investment and the company 's long-term value .	Thus from equation ( 9.33 ) the delay >>per<< cascaded section is correspondingly shorter and the longest delay that can be achieved by means of a low-pass , L-C , ladder filter is rather a small fraction of the fundamental period or pulse duration of the signal being handled .	It is certainly not justified on the basis of the 1991 earnings >>per<< share -- 2.58p -- or the outlook for 1992.	We are maintaining a significant presence in Northern Ireland : there will still be a higher percentage of volunteers >>per<< head of population there than in all but two of the other TAVRA areas .

The only evidence of the cost of repainting was expressed in terms of a rate >>per<< square metre .	A beneficial health care activity is one that generates a positive number of QALYs , and an efficient health care activity is one for which the cost >>per<< QALY is low .	On the one hand , industry is achieving much greater productivity >>per<< worker than in previous decades , and so employing fewer production workers , yet paying much higher salaries and wages to the individual worker .	The ` standard cost ' >>per<< unit is then calculated from these rates .	What these cowboys do is produce a measuring stick and quote what seems a cheap price >>per<< line on the stick .	Moreover , the average number of graphs >>per<< annual report ( of those companies using graphs ) was 7.5 , with financial graphs tending to be prominently displayed near the front of the report .	The underlying reasons for this will be considered more fully below but in general it seems clear that large , volume production industries were characterised by low throughput >>per<< worker because of over-manning and insufficient intensity of capital use [ Bacon and Eltis , 1974 ; Pratten , 1971 , 1976a ] .	Given this measure , dividends >>per<< share are determined by where is the target dividend payout ratio .	It is calculated by dividing the share price by the company 's earnings >>per<< share .	The major difference is that a limit on HLCAs >>per<< farm exists in the French LFA ( either 30 or 40 LUs per farm depending on LFA zone ) but not in the UK , encouraging farm expansion , capital developments and overstocking in the UK uplands .	The countries with the highest level of robots >>per<< employee , Japan and Sweden , both have very low rates of unemployment .	Scotland shows some evidence for a higher alcohol consumption than England and a higher rate of admission to psychiatric institutions with alcoholism or alcoholic psychosis : in 1980 the age standardised rate >>per<< 100000 for male patients was 58.4 in Scotland and 11.0 in England .	The financial effort the nation has been called on to make is a very large one , especially since the cost of construction per kW of nuclear capacity is about 25 per cent higher than the cost >>per<< kW of coal-fired capacity .	As the Member of Parliament for my former constituency , I represented the town of Troon , a very Tory town that had more millionaires >>per<< head of population than any other area in the United Kingdom .	The Panel said that industrial group Williams Holdings plc and Ultramar , the oil company since acquired by Lasmo , had both boosted earnings >>per<< share figures for the year ended 31 December 1990.	Over the same distance , people use two and a half times more energy ( >>per<< kilogram of their bulk ) than the average camel .
